# Twitter-Auto-Pilot
Automate common Twitter activities such as following &amp; unfollowing twitter accounts. 

This script makes use of the Twitter API to effortlessly follow users of a certain user. 
* Unfollow users who are not following you back.
* Set the max delay in seconds between api requests (following or unfollowing).
* Set the max amount of users to unfollow in one run of this script.
* Set the max amount of users to follow in one run of this script.

# How to Use
1. Open up one of the examples in the pilots folder (e.g. applandr/index.php)
2. Create a copy of this file in a new folder (name of the folder does not matter but the file must be called index.php)
3. Create a new twitter app at https://apps.twitter.com
4. Browse to your newly created app (on https://apps.twitter.com)
5. Copy in your four keys (Consumer Key & Secret and Access Token & Secret) to your newly created file (index.php) in step one
6. Check the logs for detailed info on what your script is doing when executed.

If you have trouble copying the correct keys check out the following article:

# Future
In the near future I plan to add many more types of Twitter functions.

* Follow users of user who have the most followers.
* Follow users of a user with the most tweets.
* Follow users of a user with the most re-tweets.

Feel free to Fork ;)
